Accessibility and Semantic Decisions:
1. Semantic HTML elements like the header, nav, main, section and footer were used to improve accessibility and provide structure to assistive technologies.
2. Labels are linked to form inputs using the for attribute to ensure users can understand form fields.
3. The "Skip to content" link was added for navigation for users with disabilities.
